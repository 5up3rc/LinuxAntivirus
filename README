Installation & Testing:

The antivirus software can be installed only if the user has root privileges.  Antivirus scan can be executed by normal user.
Here are the steps to get the antivirus code and install antivirus:
		
1.	From Virtual Box, import the Virtual Disk Image provided along with this project. Start the machine with the credentials:
	username: warlock
	password: CSE509PROJECT
		
2.	After starting the machine, run the following script from the directory /usr/src/linux-headers-4.2.0-27-generic/LinuxAntivirus/scripts/ to install antivirus module:
		antivirus_install
		
3.	After the script is executed, the antivirus module is inserted into the kernel and scanning starts

4.	The on demand mode of antivirus scan can be executed using the following command:
		antivirus_scan testfiles/ 
		This would scan the whole of testfiles directory.
		antivirus_scan testfiles/testfile1
		This would scan only testfile1 of testfiles directory.
		antivirus_scan testfiles/   testfiles2/
		This would first scan testfiles directory, then scan testfiles2 directory.
		
5.	Every file which is opened or executed by the user is scanned for virus and appropriate action is taken.
		
6.	Run cat command to open a virus file - On Access mode
		cat testfiles/testfile1
		
7.	The module could also be tested by executing the following command within the /usr/src/linux-headers-4.2.0-27-generic/LinuxAntivirus/scripts/ folder by which all the open and execve related system calls are invoked
		./testprogram
		
8.	To update the whitelist and blacklist file, the following script is to be executed when the antivirus module is not inserted: 
		antivirus_update

PLEASE NOTE: 
1. Once antivirus is ran, the virus files get renamed having ".virus" appended to the name.
    Ideal way to test would be to keep a copy of a folder, run on the copy, uninstall antivirus
    and again get the original folder to continue testing.
2. The testfiles by default have root access only. If you need to scan the testfiles with user privileges, please create files on which user has access.
